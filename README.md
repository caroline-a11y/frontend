# Introduction
Now that you've learned the fundamentals of React, it's time to practice and expand your skills by making a React project from scratch!

This assignment is open-ended when it comes to the actual content. You are free to create whatever you'd like, as long as it incorporates the requirements listed in these instructions.
# Requirements
- You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
- Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized
- There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-routerLinks to an external site.
- Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
- You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
